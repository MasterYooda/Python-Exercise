This exercise aims to find the maximum number of coins that two robots can gain
when traversing through a matrix.

An example input is:

4 3
2 4 5 3 1 2 5 2 5 2 3 6

The input corresponds to a 4 by 3 matrix as follows:

2 4 5
3 1 2
5 2 5
2 3 6

Each number represents the number of coins stored in each block.

Robots start from the top-left and top-right corner respectively.
They must reach bottom-left and bottom-right corner respectively.

The following is an example of a valid path:

2 4 5
|   |
3 1 2
|  /
5 2 5
|  \
2 3 6

Robots must travel to the next row, but can choose to move to adjacent columns or stay in the same column.
They collect all coins on the block they travel on.
In the path above, the total number of coins collected is 2+3+5+2+5+2+2+6 = 27.


If both robots travel to the same block, they can only get the coin in the block once (One robot will get nothing!)

2 4 5
|   |
3 1 2
 \ /
5 2 5
 / \
2 3 6

For this path, both robot travels on the middle block in the 3rd row therefore
the total number of coins is 2+3+2+2+ 5+2+0+6 = 22

The aim is to find the maximum number of total coins that robots can collect, if they travel according to the rule above.
